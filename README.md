# Example Starter

This example starter is bootstrapped from following the instructions at:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZkjQ0XqPN0BT7ky0yi5SNHSVszzK_w5hsCXpiBPgVBI/edit?usp=sharing

It contains a few other helpful additions to the instructions, such as:
* An example of how to call the Firebase Functions from [App.tsx](hosting/src/App.tsx) and [sdk.ts](hosting/src/sdk.ts).
* An example of how to call Firestore from the Firebase Functions in [index.ts](functions/src/index.ts).

Do note that the examples and general structure of this codebase is not intended to be a good example
of clean architecture/code. Please only use this project as a starting point.
